# About Me

Hi! I'm a recent **Computer Engineering graduate from Politecnico di Milano**.  
Iâ€™ve worked on **software projects and other different experiences**, which helped me build a versatile skill set and a practical approach to problem-solving.  
Always curious to explore new technologies and ideas!
